# Portfolio-Website
This is the first ever website I coded that holds all of my work. The HTML and CSS are here for you to see.

Because I am self taught, I have relied on online courses to learn. freeCodeCamp and many YouTube videos have helped teach me and explain new concepts. My freelance experience has turned me into a confident front-end developer now, and I am ready for a new challenege within a forward-thinking, innovative business.
